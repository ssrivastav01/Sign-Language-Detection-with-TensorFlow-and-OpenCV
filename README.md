# Sign-Language-Detection-with-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV
This project focuses on real-time hand gesture recognition using a powerful combination of TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It's designed to be a practical demonstration of how machine learning can be applied to interpret human gestures in real time, opening up possibilities for interactive applications and human-computer interaction.
**Prerequisites:**

Before diving into this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Python: You'll need Python 3.x installed on your system. The project was developed using Python 3.8.8.

OpenCV: This computer vision library is essential for image and video processing. Install it using pip install opencv-python.

MediaPipe: This framework, developed by Google, provides pre-trained machine learning solutions, including hand recognition. Install it with pip install mediapipe.

TensorFlow: This powerful machine learning library is used for deep learning tasks. Install it using pip install tensorflow.

NumPy: This library is used for numerical operations and array manipulation. It's usually included with most Python distributions.

**Project Overview**

The project aims to create a real-time hand gesture recognizer. It achieves this by leveraging the strengths of different technologies:

MediaPipe: This framework is responsible for detecting the hand within the webcam's field of view and identifying 21 key points on the hand. These key points represent the hand's landmarks, such as fingertips, knuckles, and the base of the palm.

TensorFlow: A pre-trained TensorFlow model is used to classify the hand pose based on the extracted key points. This model has been trained on a dataset of various hand gestures, allowing it to recognize specific poses like "okay," "peace," "thumbs up," and more.

OpenCV: This library is used for real-time video capture from the webcam, image processing tasks (like converting the image to RGB format), and displaying the results (showing the video feed with detected landmarks and recognized gestures).

**How It Works**

Import Libraries: The necessary Python packages (OpenCV, NumPy, MediaPipe, TensorFlow) are imported to provide the required functionalities.

Initialize Models: MediaPipe's hand detection model is initialized, and the pre-trained TensorFlow gesture recognition model is loaded.

Capture Video: The webcam is initialized, and a continuous loop starts to read frames from the video stream.

Hand Detection and Keypoint Extraction: Each frame is processed by MediaPipe to detect the hand and extract the 21 key points representing its landmarks.

Gesture Recognition: The extracted landmarks are fed into the TensorFlow model, which predicts the most likely gesture being performed.

Display Results: The video frame is updated to show the detected hand landmarks and the recognized gesture label.

Exit Condition: The loop continues until the user presses the 'q' key, at which point the webcam is released, and the windows are closed.

**Output**

The output of the project is a real-time video feed from your webcam. In this feed, you'll see:

Hand Landmarks: Dots and lines overlaid on your hand, representing the 21 key points detected by MediaPipe.

Gesture Label: A text label displayed on the screen, indicating the recognized hand gesture (e.g., "okay," "peace").

This project provides a foundation for building more complex applications that can be controlled or interacted with using hand gestures. It demonstrates the potential of machine learning and computer vision in creating intuitive and natural ways for humans to interact with technology.
