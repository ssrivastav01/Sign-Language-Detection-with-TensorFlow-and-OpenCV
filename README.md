# Sign-Language-Detection-with-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV
This project focuses on real-time hand gesture recognition using a powerful combination of TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It's designed to be a practical demonstration of how machine learning can be applied to interpret human gestures in real time, opening up possibilities for interactive applications and human-computer interaction.
